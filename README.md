# Overview

"TODD's Trash" follows a robot named T.O.D.D., or Trash Operation Delivery Device, through an abandoned city where it is tasked with delivering the trash to certain locations to keep the trash balance between those locations. With this one goal programmed into its mind, TODD finds another goal during the game, companionship. TODD now has a second goal in mind: building a friend to keep it company. TODD will discover pieces to build a friend throughout the levels of the game.

This game is about expressing the challenges of balancing your work life with your personal life. The player will see this through the perspective of TODD when the task to build a friend is revealed, causing TODD to have to balance these two different lifestyles. This game is an original title and an alternative approach to the platformer genre. We believe that the game is an alternative because of the lack of enemies when most games in the genre do have enemies. Another reason our group sees our game as an alternative is because we arenâ€™t necessarily going from left to right, the player goes between both sides to balance trash and then completes a level once the trash is balanced. Actions throughout the game also relate to the theme of balance as the player is tasked with balancing the trash in the game and also balancing the two lifestyles.
